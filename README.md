What is in the project:<p>
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Feature Engineering (feature scaling, checking multicollinearity)
4. Machine learning modeling with classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Linear SVC, AdaBoost, Random Forest)
5. Apply prediction to new and unseen data

Highest accuracy; Linear SVC with around 97% accuracy
